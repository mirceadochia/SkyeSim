This is the FGPanel for the Raspberry Pi running Raspbian.
It should work with other Linux distributions but it has not been tested.

INSTALLATION
============

1. Build SimGear as usual.
   OSG, Plib, GLUT,... will be required even they are not strictly needed to run FGPanel.

2. Configure FlightGear using CMake as usual.
   CMakeLists.txt is used to compile FGPanel with OpenGL 2.0.
   This should make FGPanel faster on modern graphics cards.

   CMakeLists.txt is used to compile FGPanel with OpenGL ES 2.0 for the Raspberry Pi.
   The source code of FGPanel can easily be adapted to other embedded devices supporting OpenGL ES 2.0.

3. Build FGPanel only (don't build all components on the Raspberry Pi as this will take ages!!!):
        make -- fgpanel

USAGE
=====

1. Increase the amount of GPU memory by editing the /boot/config.txt file.
   Add the following line (this is for Raspberry Pi model 1B with 512 Mb of memory):
        gpu_mem_512=256

2. Reboot and check the amount of GPU memory:
        vcgencmd get_mem gpu

3. Stop X server. FGPanel runs in the console (Linux framebuffer).

4. Start FGPanel as usual but as ROOT or use the 'sudo' command (see README):
        sudo -- utils/fgpanel/fgpanel --fg-root=/path/to/fg/data --panel=Aircraft/MyAircraft/Panels/MyPanel.xml

   ROOT privileges are required to access the GPU of the Raspberry Pi.

FEATURES
========

- Use OpenGL 2.0 instead of OpenGL 1.0 (fixed pipeline) using CMakeLists.txt.
- Use OpenGL ES 2.0 to run on the Raspberry Pi using CMakeLists.txt.
- Use VideoCore 4 graphics hardware acceleration (GPU) of the Raspberry Pi.
- Run at 30 frames per second.
- Don't use PLib anymore for the font rendering.
